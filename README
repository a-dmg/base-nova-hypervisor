This repository contains the NOVA r.22.52 port for Genode.

The NOVA microhypervisor combines microkernel and hypervisor functionality
and provides an extremely small trusted computing base for user applications
and virtual machines running on top of it. The microhypervisor implements a
capability-based authorization model and provides basic mechanisms for
virtualization, spatial and temporal separation, scheduling, communication,
and management of platform resources.

For more information on this base platform, please refer to the official
website.
