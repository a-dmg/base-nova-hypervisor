This repository contains the NOVA r.22.52 port for Genode.

Brief
=====

The NOVA microhypervisor combines microkernel and hypervisor functionality
and provides an extremely small trusted computing base for user applications
and virtual machines running on top of it. The microhypervisor implements a
capability-based authorization model and provides basic mechanisms for
virtualization, spatial and temporal separation, scheduling, communication,
and management of platform resources.

For more information on this base platform, please refer to the official
website.

Getting Started
===============

Clone this repository and sim-link it into your local copy of Genode under the
'repos/' directory.

Currently only x86_64 is supported, but aarch64 is also intended to be made
available.

Into your build conf located at 'genode/build/x86_64/etc/build.conf' update the
boot_dir selection with:

! NOVA_HYPERVISOR_DIR:= /<path_to>/base-nova-hypervisor
! ifdef KERNEL
! ifeq (KERNEL, nova-hypervisor)
! RUN_OPT += --include $(NOVA_HYPERVISOR_DIR)boot_dir/$(KERNEL)
! else
! RUN_OPT += --include boot_dir/$(KERNEL)
! endif
! endif

This avoid having changes into the genode git repository for the bood_dir
generation script.

You can now run 'make run/nova-hypervisor'
